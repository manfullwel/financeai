# 🚀 FinanceAI CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the FinanceAI project. Our pipeline automates testing, building, and deployment processes to ensure code quality and reliable deployments.

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. 🧪 Test Stage
The first stage runs all automated tests to ensure code quality.

#### Backend Tests:
- Python unit tests using pytest
- Code style checks (PEP 8)
- Type checking with mypy

#### Frontend Tests:
- React component tests with Jest
- TypeScript type checking
- ESLint code style verification

### 2. 🏗️ Build Stage
Builds Docker images for both frontend and backend services.

#### Backend Build:
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for backend
FROM python:3.12-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["uvicorn", "src.api.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0"]
```

#### Frontend Build:
```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for frontend
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json yarn.lock ./
RUN yarn install
COPY . .
RUN yarn build

FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/.next ./.next
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./
CMD ["yarn", "start"]
```

### 3. 🚀 Deploy Stage
Automated deployment to Railway.app platform.

#### Deployment Process:
1. Railway CLI authentication
2. Environment variable configuration
3. Docker image deployment
4. Health check verification

## Infrastructure as Code

### Docker Compose Configuration:
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports: ["3000:3000"]
  backend:
    build: .
    ports: ["8000:8000"]
  db:
    image: postgres:14
```

### Railway Configuration:
```toml
[build]
builder = "DOCKERFILE"
dockerfilePath = "docker-compose.yml"

[deploy]
startCommand = "docker-compose up"
healthcheckPath = "/health"
```

## 🔄 Continuous Integration Flow

1. Developer pushes code to GitHub
2. GitHub Actions triggers pipeline
3. Run tests in parallel
4. Build Docker images
5. Deploy to staging/production

## 🛡️ Security Measures

- Secrets management via Railway
- Environment variable encryption
- Docker image vulnerability scanning
- JWT authentication
- HTTPS enforcement

## 📊 Monitoring

- Application metrics with Prometheus
- Log aggregation with Railway
- Error tracking
- Performance monitoring

## 🚨 Alert System

- Deployment status notifications
- Error rate alerts
- Performance degradation warnings
- Resource usage alerts

## 📝 Best Practices

1. **Version Control**
   - Use semantic versioning
   - Maintain clean commit history
   - Write descriptive commit messages

2. **Testing**
   - Write comprehensive unit tests
   - Perform integration testing
   - Conduct end-to-end testing

3. **Security**
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Security scanning
   - Access control implementation

4. **Deployment**
   - Zero-downtime deployments
   - Rollback capability
   - Environment parity

## 🔄 Rollback Procedure

1. Identify deployment issue
2. Execute railway rollback
3. Verify system stability
4. Investigate root cause

## 📈 Performance Optimization

- Docker layer caching
- Multi-stage builds
- Resource optimization
- Cache implementation

## 🎯 Future Improvements

1. Implement automated UI testing
2. Add performance testing stage
3. Enhance security scanning
4. Implement blue-green deployments
